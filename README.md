# Dice Roll
This project was implemented during IT studies as part of a Java programming class. Outside of classes, I expanded the project with several new features. The goal was to implement simple dice software.

## General Info
The project aimed to implement an object-oriented approach to programming in Java. The game can be played in different modes:
- Quick singleplayer game
- Game mode (Singleplayer/Multiplayer, Customised settings):
  - The user first selects the game mode
  - If multiplayer is selected, the user manages players (including computer players)
  - Selecting the number of rounds

Moreover, in each mode the user indicates whether he wants to have a game with statistics or not

## Technologies
The project was implemented using:
* Java - JDK 21.0.2
